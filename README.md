LPC11U24Gadget
==============

Generally speaking, makers of integrated circuits do not document their products in a way
that's friendly or understandable for software engineers, hobbyists, hackers or creative
types.  This project aims to make the built-in USB features of the inexpensive, powerful
and flexible [**NXP LPC11U2x microcontroller**](http://www.nxp.com/products/microcontrollers/cortex_m0_m0/LPC11U24FHI33.html)
available to the aforementioned groups by exposing a simple API based on [**Galago**](http://github.com/OutbreakInc/Galago)
with additional features.


This project is a work-in-progress.
